# Detecting-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Using-CNNs
This project aims to build a system that can automatically classify retinal images based on the severity of DR into five categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. The system must be able to handle common challenges such as uneven class distribution, differences in image quality, and the need for consistent preprocessing.
